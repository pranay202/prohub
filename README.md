# Project Description

## Problem Description

> Students are unaware of project that are already built.
Difficulties in selecting innovative and unique ideas. 
Project idea will get rejected if it is already done.
Again they need to put lots of efforts to find different project ideas.



## Solution
> We brought all project works and details on single platform -
To avoid project ideas from getting repeated, 
To take up unique and innovative project works,
To provide common knowledge platform for peer learning.
